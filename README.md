# smartAPI Profiler
Web application to automatically identify resources provided by a database 
by "profiling" a web service response from the database. The application profiles 
the web service response to create a keypath and value mapping where the keypath 
contains one or more keys (strings) concatenated with a dot. The individual keys 
are obtained by recursively traversing the web service response until the remaining 
value is either a string or a list of strings. 

To identify a resource provided by the database, the individual elements of 
the keypath are then used to search Identifiers.org for a match to a resource name 
or synonym. If a match is found, this is displayed as the value for the Mapped Resource. 
If a match is not found, a sample value from the keypath-value mapping is used to find 
resources whose values match the pattern of this keypath. Matching resources are 
displayed as resources with a pattern match.

The application is used together with the [smartAPI Editor](http://smart-api.info/editor/) 
and submits data to the `responseDataType` field of the Editor.
